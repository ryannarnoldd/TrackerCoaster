# Trackercoaster

## Description

TrackerCoaster is Project 1 for the UCF Coding Bootcamp. It was a simple web application that allows you to rate and track your experience on multiple rollercoasters ridden in the Florida community. You are able to track the scariness, theming, and enjoyment of each coaster, while also adding any comments, if necessary. We built this project to help those coaster enthusiats track their stats for each coaster they ride. There is not a present solution to this problem that is as detailed and minimalist as ours. We learned how to use all three components, HTML, CSS, and JS all in a web application to create our vision, while also utilizing localStorage to keep user data, Bootstrap 5 for other interactives, and Github Pages to host the product.
